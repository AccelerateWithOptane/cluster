# Accelerate With Optane Cluster
Request access to Optane powered bare metal infrastructure for performance-testing and analysis purposes

The [Accelerate With Optane cluster](https://www.acceleratewithoptane.com/cluster) provides free access to state-of-the-art Intel servers with Intel Optane ultra-high-speed SSD and persistent memory for open source developers working to get the most performance in terms of IO from their software. We currently provide access to the Optane drives as block storage devices, with potential options for Intel Memory Drive Technology (IMDT).

The on-demand infrastructure resource is managed by New York City-based Packet, a leading bare metal cloud, as part of its commitment to making it easier for online innovators to succeed with infrastructure that pushes the envelope of performance and value for their users. Funding for the systems is provided by Intel. The resources are primarily located in Packet's EWR1 (New York City area) data center.

Apply to Use the On-Demand Infrastructure by [creating an issue](https://github.com/AccelerateWithOptane/cluster/issues/new) in this repository. Contact avi@packet.net (Avi Deitcher, Accelerate With Optane program manager) for any questions.

Request access and then get up and running in minutes!
