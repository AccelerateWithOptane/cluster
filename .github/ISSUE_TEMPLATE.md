If you are interested in filing a request for access to the Accelerate With Optane performance test and 
analysis Community Lab, please fill out the details below, or contact Avi Deitcher at avi@packet.net with questions.

If you are just making a comment, ignore/delete those fields and file your issue.

### Name, email, company, job title

Note that projects with two or more participants are preferred.

### Project Title and description

### How does the open source community benefit from your work?

### Is the code that youâ€™re going to run 100% open source? If so, what is the URL or URLs where it is located?

### What infrastructure (computing resources and network access) do you need? (see: https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/)?

Let us know if you need short-term (one time) support, or if this is a request for
continuous ongoing support. If possible, please identify foundations or other
support organizations that can help with long-running projects.

### What performance-focused articles has your project published?

Is your project intensely interested in performance, especially where disk I/O is concerned? Have you written about it, or shared results of testing? Share anything that shows your focus.

### Please state your contributions to the open source community and any other relevant initiatives

Brag a little bit about yourself, please!

### Would you be willing to share your analysis and results publicly? 

We are interested in blog posts, meetups and conference presentations. AccelerateWithOptane would be more than happy to host your blog posts or link to them, and may coordinate performance-oriented meetups and conferences. Are you open to sharing?

### Are you interested in testing Optane SSDs with Intel Memory Drive Technology (IMDT)?

IMDT extends system memory transparently by integrating Optane SSD capacity into the memory subsystem, effectively expanding your memory pool beyond system DRAM capacities at a much lower cost. Check [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/optane-ssd-dc-p4800x-mdt-brief.html) for more information.
