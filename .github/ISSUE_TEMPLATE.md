If you are interested in filing a request for access to the Accelerate With Optane Community Lab for performance testing, optimization, and analysis, please fill out the details below. Contact Avi Deitcher at avi@packet.net with questions.

### Name, email, company, job title

*Note that projects with two or more participants are preferred.*

### Project Title and brief description



### How does the open source community benefit from your work?



### Is the code that youâ€™re going to run 100% open source? If so, what is the URL or URLs where it is located?



### Does the infrastructure provided meet your testing needs (see: https://www.acceleratewithoptane.com/access/)?

*Note that the configuration provided was created to enable testing flexibility across a range of potential use cases. Projects are expected to use one system due to limited supply. If additional resources are required, contact avi@packet.net*



### What performance-focused articles has your project published before?

*Is your project intensely interested in performance, especially where disk I/O is concerned? Have you written about it or shared results of testing? Please share anything that shows your focus.*



### Please state your contributions to the open source community and any other relevant initiatives

*Feel free to brag a little bit about yourself!*



### Would you be willing to share your analysis and results publicly? 

*We are interested in blog posts, meetups and conference presentations. Accelerate With Optane would be more than happy to host your blog posts or link to them, and may coordinate performance-oriented meetups and conferences. Are you open to sharing?*



### Are you interested in testing Intel Optane SSDs with Intel Memory Drive Technology (IMDT)?

*IMDT extends system memory transparently by integrating Intel Optane SSD capacity into the memory subsystem. The systems provided have 192GB of DRAM but can be enabled with 1.4TB of software-defined memory while leaving one Intel Optane SSD still available for fast storage/caching usage. Check [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/optane-ssd-dc-p4800x-mdt-brief.html) for more information on IMDT.*
